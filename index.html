        Help! Rice University has been overrun by squirrels! It was only a matter of time.
        You need to help save the campus and shoot these hotdogs that you stole from the servery at the
        hungry squirrels so that they'll go away!<br>
        Instructions: Use the mouse to move the player left to right, click to shoot.
        The squirrels will come faster and more will come as the game goes on, so be prepared!
